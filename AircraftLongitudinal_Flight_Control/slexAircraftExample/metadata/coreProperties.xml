  <dc:description>Aircraft Longitudinal Flight Control

This example shows how to model flight control for the longitudinal motion of an aircraft.
First order linear approximations of the aircraft and actuator behavior are connected
to an analog flight control design that uses the pilot's stick pitch command as the set point for the 
aircraft's pitch attitude and uses aircraft pitch angle and pitch rate to determine commands.   A 
simplified Dryden wind gust model is incorporated to perturb the system.

The Viewers and Generators Manager was used in this model to create the model scope for 
viewing signals, Scope1.  Found on Simulation -&gt; Prepare -&gt; Viewers Manager, the Viewers and 
Generators Manager allows you to instrument your model without having to add blocks to the 
model.  If you close a model scope, such as for batch simulations, you can later reopen it 
by double-clicking the "scope" icon on the signal of interest.

Parameters for the model are stored in a file named slexAircraftData.m.  This file is loaded 
by the model into the model workspace.  You can view and edit data in the model workspace 
directly by using the Model Explorer, which is launched using the Modeling -&gt; Design 
-&gt; Model Explorer menu item.
